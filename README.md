Site for Svenska Pudelklubben, built on `_s`

### Project description

The organization wanted a new website with the following requirements:

- Easy to navigate and find information
- Simple for editors to update
- Local branches should be part of the main site instead of having separate pages
- Enhanced security

After discussions with organization representatives and analyzing the site, I decided to build a theme with locked templates. The editors are not always tech-savvy, so providing fewer options makes updating feel simpler. Each branch has its own page type and template. The organization also developed a new graphic profile, which I implemented on the site in collaboration with the designer.
