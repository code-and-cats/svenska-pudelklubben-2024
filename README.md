Site for Svenska Pudelklubben, built on `_s`

### Project description

The organization wanted a new website with the following requirements:

- Easy to navigate and find information
- Simple for editors to update
- Local branches should be part of the main site instead of having separate pages
- Enhanced security

## What I did

After discussions with organization representatives and analyzing the site, I decided to build a theme with simple and non-editable templates. The editors are not always tech-savvy, so providing fewer options makes updating feel simpler. The organization also developed a new graphic profile, which I implemented on the site in collaboration with the designer.

- Fewer pages for easier navigation
- A custom sidebar for extra information which has previously been separate pages
- Local branches have their own page types and templates in the theme
- Accessibility checked by both online tools and users
- Set up a bare repo
